As you earn experience points from completing quests, defeating enemies, exploring the world, and other activities, your character will gradually gain levels. The maximum level cap in ESO is currently 50.",
        part3 : "Attribute Points: As your character levels up, you'll earn attribute points that can be allocated to increase your Health, Magicka, or Stamina. These attributes affect your character's survivability, magical abilities, and physical prowess, respectively. You can distribute attribute points according to your preferred playstyle and build.",
        part4 : "Skill Points: In addition to attribute points, you'll also earn skill points as you level up. Skill points can be spent to unlock and upgrade various abilities in your character's skill lines. Each class, weapon type, armor type, and crafting profession has its own skill line, offering a wide range of abilities and playstyles to choose from.",
        part5 : "Skill Lines: Skill lines represent the different abilities and passives that your character can acquire throughout the game. By using specific weapons, wearing certain types of armor, or engaging in particular activities like crafting, you'll progress in the corresponding skill lines and unlock new abilities. Skill lines can be leveled up by gaining experience in the associated activities or by spending skill points to unlock new abilities and passives.",
        part6 : "Champion Points (CP): Once you reach level 50, your character will start earning Champion Points instead of traditional experience points. Champion Points are account-wide and can be spent in the Champion System to further customize and enhance your character's abilities. Champion Points are divided into different constellations, each offering unique bonuses and passives that can be unlocked as you accumulate more points.",
        part7 : "Level Scaling: ESO features a level-scaling system that adjusts the difficulty of enemies and content based on your character's level. This means that you can explore any area of the game world at any level, and the enemies you encounter will scale to match your level. This allows for a more flexible and open-ended gameplay experience, where you're not restricted to specific zones based on your level.",
        part8 : "Overall, the leveling system in ESO is designed to provide players with a sense of progression and customization as they develop their characters' skills, abilities, and attributes. Whether you prefer questing, dungeon delving, PvP combat, or crafting, there are plenty of opportunities to earn experience and advance your character in The Elder Scrolls Online.",

Light attack weaving not only increases damage output but also helps to generate Ultimate faster and sustain resources.",
        part4: "Heavy Attack Weaving: Heavy attack weaving, similar to light attack weaving, involves incorporating heavy attacks between ability casts. Heavy attacks deal more damage than light attacks and restore resources based on the type of weapon used (Magicka for staves, Stamina for melee weapons). By weaving heavy attacks into their rotation, players can manage their resources more effectively while dealing significant damage.",
        part5: "Animation Cancelling: Weaving relies on animation cancelling, which involves interrupting the animation of one action (such as a light or heavy attack) with another action (such as casting an ability). This allows players to maximize their damage output by reducing the time between attacks and abilities.",
        part6: "Practice and Timing: Mastering weaving requires practice and precise timing. Players need to familiarize themselves with the animation lengths of their abilities and attacks to execute weaving effectively. It's essential to maintain a steady rhythm and fluid motion to seamlessly integrate attacks and abilities.",
        part7: "Role-Specific Weaving: Different roles in ESO utilize weaving differently. Damage dealers (DPS) prioritize weaving to maximize their damage output, while tanks and healers may incorporate weaving for resource management or to contribute additional damage when appropriate.Role-Specific Weaving: Different roles in ESO utilize weaving differently. Damage dealers (DPS) prioritize weaving to maximize their damage output, while tanks and healers may incorporate weaving for resource management or to contribute additional damage when appropriate.",
